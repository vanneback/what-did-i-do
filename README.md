# What-did-i-do

This repository provides a easy way to find all commits from a certain date.

### Usage

keep all the root directories you wish to search in folders.txt. They will be searched relatively
from your home folder. Keep one directory per line.

```
./what-did-i-do.sh yyyy-mm-dd
```

Standard dates work as date. Example `today`,`yesterday` or `2019-11-10` will all work as an argument.
